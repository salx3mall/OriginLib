OriginLib is a demo (and training) project I plan to finish in 2020.
What do I want this application to be able to do:
-Implement fully-functional CLI;
-Accept the data about a book and an author;
-Allow user to log in (and off) to the user account safely (with ciphering the password);
-Sort input data with the merge and quick sort algorithms;
-Store data in the SQL-oriented database;
-[questionable]Have a web interface;
What different kinds of work (or components) should be performed for this work:
-Object-oriented application written using the C++ labguage;
-Database connection;
-Hashing algorithm for user passwords;
-Merge and quick sorting algorithms;
-UML modelling of the main classes infrastructures;
-[questionable]Web page, handled by the MVC pattern.
